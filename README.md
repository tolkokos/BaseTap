# BaseTap

Instant onchain payment button for the Base ecosystem. Accepts ETH (and later ERC-20 like USDC), forwards funds to a treasury, and uses an upgradeable proxy (UUPS) to keep the logic evolvable. Built with Solidity + Hardhat and designed for GitHub Actions/Codespaces only.

## Why BaseTap

- Onchain-first signal: upgradeable proxy, clear deployments and addresses.
- Built for Base: targets Base Mainnet and Base Sepolia.
- Simple integration: one contract, one button, one treasury.
- Prepared for growth: Base Pay / Base Account SDK integration planned.

## Features

**V2 Enhancements:**
- 📊 Complete payment history tracking with reference IDs
- 🏪 Multi-merchant registry and payment routing
- 📈 Real-time payment analytics and statistics
- 🔍 Advanced event indexing for off-chain applications
- 💾 Structured storage with mappings and structs

**Core Features:**
- ETH and ERC-20 (USDC) payments with instant forwarding
- TransparentUpgradeableProxy for safe contract evolution
- Pausable and non-reentrant execution guards
- Per-network deployment JSONs tracked on-chain
- Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

---

## Addresses & Deployments

Deployment files are stored per chain. Example structure:

deployments/
  base-mainnet.json
  base-sepolia.json

Each file should include:
- proxy: proxy address
- implementation: implementation address
- timestamp: ISO string
- contract: contract name
- network: chain name

> First onchain deployments will land with v0.1.0-rc.* pre-releases.

## Quick Start (GitHub Codespaces / Actions only)

1. Open this repo in Codespaces.
2. Create a `.env` file with required keys (see repository secrets/variables):
   - `PRIVATE_KEY` - deployer private key
   - `OWNER_ADDRESS` - contract owner address
   - `TREASURY_ADDRESS` - treasury address for payments
   - `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` - for contract verification
   - RPC URLs (optional, defaults to public RPCs)
3. Install deps:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```
4. Compile:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
5. Run static checks:
   ```bash
   npm run lint || true
   ```

> All deploys are executed via GitHub Actions `workflow_dispatch`.

## Roadmap

- v0.1.0-rc: initial UUPS proxy deployments (Base Sepolia, then Base Mainnet)
- v0.1.0: public release, README with tx links, minimal UI example
- v0.1.x: Base Pay and Base Account SDK integration
- v0.2.x: ERC-20 (USDC) support, reference IDs, events indexing

---

## Security

- UUPS upgradeability with owner-gated upgrades
- Pausable and ReentrancyGuard
- Minimal external calls and checks-effects-interactions
- See SECURITY.md for reporting and scope

---

## Ecosystem Integration

BaseTap is built for the Base ecosystem and integrates with:
- **Base Pay SDK** - seamless payment experience
- **Base Account SDK** - smart contract wallet integration
- **Base Network** - low-cost, fast transactions
- **BaseScan** - contract verification and transparency
